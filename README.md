# Grocery-List
This is a grocery shopping project. On this project, I organized my grocery list using the following requirements.

1. Incorporating the major HTML semantic tags.
2. Each category of grocery in its own "section".
3. Each Sections has its own background colors.
4. Section headers have background colors.
5. The main header has a different color.
6 Used three types of headings.
7. Included two types of lists.
8. Used a box model to add borders and spacing to each section.
9. Added two photos with padding so it is nicely spaced away from the text element.
10. CSS incorporated using an external CSS file, internal in the header, and inline.
